# UNO Project

As part of the CMPT-201 class (Intro to Computer Science) at Westminster, I had a project to create a UNO player in Java and optimize the player's score based on the various UNO rules. The goal of the project was to implement a program that could play the game of UNO by following the standard rules and making optimal decisions to maximize the player's score.

To complete the project, I had to first understand the rules of UNO and the different strategies that could be employed to win the game. I then had to design and implement the program in Java, ensuring that it could accurately play the game and make the best possible decisions. During the project, I also learned the importance of testing and debugging, as well as the need for careful documentation and version control. By keeping track of my progress and regularly updating my code, I was able to identify and fix issues quickly and ensure that my program was functioning correctly.


Overall, the project helped me develop my programming skills in Java and taught me valuable lessons in computer science and software development. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that provided me with a solid foundation for future projects in computer science.
